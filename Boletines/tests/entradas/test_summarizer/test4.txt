1PointFive is building STRATOS, the world’s largest Direct Air Capture (DAC) facility, at a pace that demonstrates how quickly large-scale carbon removal can become a reality. Designed to capture up to 500,000 metric tonnes of CO2 annually, STRATOS is a proof point for cost optimization and operational efficiency in DAC technology.

By leveraging cross-disciplinary synergies, reliable external partners, and strategic financing, STRATOS has the ability to continually iterate while positioning itself as a blueprint for future large-scale carbon removal facilities.

Cross-Disciplinary Synergies
STRATOS’ progress and success are made possible by the integration and collaboration between 1PointFive, Oxy (its parent company) and other Oxy subsidiaries including Carbon Engineering and OxyChem. Director of DAC Projects Christine Irvin, says: “Everything is a first in this project, but luckily we have an amazing team that has a history of building first-of-a-kind projects”. The synergies that exist between various Oxy entities are central to the carbon capture project’s advancement.

At the core of this effort is Carbon Engineering’s Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology, which provides the foundation for STRATOS. Carbon Engineering remains actively engaged in advancing its technology, continuously innovating to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of CO2 capture-enhancing both the current project and the future scalability of DAC solutions. The Carbon Engineering Innovation Centre (CEIC) provides an active test-bed for new technologies and training future STRATOS operations teams.

OxyChem, the chemicals subsidiary of Oxy, has been engaged to operate the STRATOS facility due to their 100 years of expertise in managing and optimizing chemical facilities and processes. This includes supplying the critical KOH (potassium hydroxide) feedstock that binds with atmospheric CO2 once it is pulled into the facility. As a global leader in KOH production and with its world-class operational expertise, OxyChem will ensure that STRATOS is continually optimized for the efficient, full-scale, and sustainable capture of atmospheric CO2.

Additionally, multiple teams across Oxy are vital to making STRATOS a reality. Oxy brings expertise in large-scale project development, CO2 handling, transportation and sequestration, renewable power, and water management. The combined expertise of our organizations is what allows us to not only build Direct Air Capture facilities, but to build them at the size and scale needed to remove large volumes of CO2 from the atmosphere, quickly.

Reliable Partnerships
In addition to relying on Oxy’s cross-disciplinary strength, 1PointFive is also collaborating with external partners like Worley and strategic suppliers to accelerate the development of STRATOS. According to Justin Schmidt, Head of Commissioning at STRATOS, “The number of companies involved on a strategic and management level is unique and has been critical to the project’s success.” Since 2021, Worley has provided critical support from front-end engineering and design (FEED) to construction, ensuring the project’s progress and efficiency.

Strategic Financing
Like any large-scale capital project, building a Direct Air Capture facility like STRATOS requires not only technical expertise and collaboration but also early financial commitments from investors committed to decarbonization. Early-stage support has been instrumental in advancing STRATOS, including a $550 million investment from BlackRock in 2023, which provided key funding for the facility’s construction. This investment underscores growing private-sector confidence in Direct Air Capture as a scalable carbon removal solution.

Beyond direct investment, STRATOS has also advanced the market through pre-sale of carbon removal credits. Corporate buyers committed to long-term emissions reductions have played a crucial role in validating market demand, committing to future carbon removal as part of their sustainability strategies. These pre-sale agreements help de-risk project development while demonstrating the growing market momentum behind durable carbon removal solutions. By aligning with investors and corporate partners through early commitments, STRATOS establishes a replicable framework for financing future Direct Air Capture facilities.

A Model for Future Carbon Removal Projects
STRATOS serves as a blueprint for scaling Direct Air Capture facilities, demonstrating the importance of internal synergies and expertise, cross-organizational collaboration, and effective financing strategies. Together they form the foundation for large-scale carbon removal projects.

Yet, it’s not just the financial backing, partnerships, or synergies that make projects like STRATOS successful. It’s the will—the desire to lead, to solve, and to innovate—that drives these ambitious undertakings forward. As Christine Irvin states, “Nothing on this project has been easy, but there has been so much satisfaction in seeing it come to life.”
